## Methodology
The algorithm uses the fact that anything above the diagonal of the matrix  will be less than the number on that row of the diagonal and anything to the right would be greater than the number in the diagonal
 If the target is less than the position it is looking at then it would go up one and if its greater then it would go right one.
